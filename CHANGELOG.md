  is used for the CN, is not greater than 64 characters as specified in the

- Use ca bundle to patch the webhook from the service account secret instead
  of fetching via kubectl.
- Set the number of retries for retrieving the issued certificate to 10 like
  the error message.
- Add the `--webhook-kind` option to specified between
  MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration. Defaults to
  MutatingWebhookConfiguration
